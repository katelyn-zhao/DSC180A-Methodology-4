## Quarter 2 Project Proposal

1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
   - The idea of changes in the microbiome being linked to disease states.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
   - Using long-read sequencing data instead of short-read sequencing data.
3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
   - We were thinking of doing some additional analysis instead of only what is replicated from the paper.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
   - I would be interested in using deep learning in my project.
